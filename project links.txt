Dear [HR Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss some critical concerns regarding the current team structure and processes within our organization.

Over the past six months, I have observed a lack of growth and numerous drawbacks in our team's operations. This has resulted in several team members leaving without proper acknowledgment, leading to a sense of instability and dissatisfaction among the remaining team members. Additionally, there have been challenges in the process, especially in handling customers and managing the sales and service aspects effectively.

Specifically, I have encountered the following issues:

No growth opportunities: Despite my dedication and efforts, there has been no visible growth or advancement in the team for an extended period.

Inadequate incentives: The current incentive structure provides limited scope for earning incentives, which has impacted motivation and morale among team members.

Process flaws and customer handling challenges: The processes, especially in sales and service, have significant flaws, making it challenging to handle customers effectively and provide satisfactory services.

Lack of updates and manpower issues: The furniture website, which is crucial for our operations, lacks updates and improvements. Additionally, the team faces challenges due to insufficient manpower and increased pressure.

Given these challenges, I no longer feel motivated or capable of continuing in my current team. I would like to explore the possibility of a team change that aligns better with my skills, interests, and career aspirations. However, if a team change is not feasible, I may need to consider spot resignation as an alternative.

I am open to discussing these concerns further and collaborating on solutions that address these challenges effectively. Your support and guidance in this matter are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter. I look forward to your prompt response.

Best regards,
