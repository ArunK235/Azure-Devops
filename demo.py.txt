If addiction to mobile is a personal weakness, there are several ways to address it.
 One approach is to set boundaries and limit the time spent on mobile devices.
 This can be done by using tools such as screen time apps, setting timers, or designating specific times of the day for mobile usage.

Another approach is to find alternative activities to engage in when the temptation to use a mobile device arises. 
This could include reading a book, going for a walk, engaging in a hobby, or spending time with friends and family.

Additionally, it may be helpful to identify the triggers that lead to mobile addiction and develop strategies to address them.
 For example, if stress is a trigger, practicing relaxation techniques such as meditation or deep breathing can help reduce the urge to use a mobile device.

Overall, improving addiction to mobile requires self-awareness, discipline, and a willingness to make changes.
 By setting boundaries, finding alternative activities, and addressing triggers, one can gradually reduce the addiction and improve overall well-being.
